🧠 Virtual Memory Management Simulator

A Virtual Memory Management Simulator built using Python (Tkinter) that visually demonstrates how an operating system manages memory using techniques like paging, segmentation, and page replacement algorithms.

This project provides an interactive way to understand key OS concepts such as logical and physical address mapping, page tables, and memory allocation.

🚀 Features

🧩 Paging Simulation: Visualize how pages and frames are allocated in main memory.

🧱 Segmentation Simulation: Understand how processes are divided into variable-sized segments.

🔄 Page Replacement Algorithms:

FIFO (First-In-First-Out)

LRU (Least Recently Used)

Optimal Replacement

📊 Address Translation: Convert logical addresses to physical addresses step by step.

💡 Interactive GUI: Built with Tkinter for an easy-to-use and educational interface.

🧮 Custom Inputs: Adjust frame size, number of pages, and address references for testing.

🧰 Tech Stack

Language: Python 3

GUI Framework: Tkinter

Concepts Covered: Virtual Memory, Paging, Segmentation, Page Tables, Page Replacement Algorithms

🎯 Educational Objective

This simulator is designed for students learning Operating Systems to:

Visualize complex memory management concepts.

Understand how page faults occur and are handled.

Experiment with different algorithms and configurations to observe performance differences.
